# Built with RiveScript

This is a collection of known projects that are built on top of RiveScript.

* [I.R.I.S. (IRIS Really Is Smart)](https://olympus-gianksp.rhcloud.com/portfolio/i-r-i-s-2012/) - a Java bot built on RiveScript-Java.
* JARVIS - Python home automation bot
    * GitHub: <https://github.com/truestealth/JARVIS>
    * G+ Group "JARVIS in the making": <https://plus.google.com/communities/103848511044640132327>
* [Tinman](https://github.com/massyn/tinman-rive) - an open source RiveScript brain
* [Domogik](https://github.com/domogik/domogik) - Home automation software that includes RiveScript in its [butler plugin](https://github.com/domogik/domogik/tree/master/src/domogik/butler)
    * Website: <http://www.domogik.org/> (French language)
* [Vixia](http://www.vixia.fr/createbot/index.php) - a French language chatbot hosting site that uses RiveScript.
    * Uses a custom PHP implementation of RiveScript ([source](http://www.vixia.fr/createbot/sources.php)) - appears to be pretty simplistic at time of writing, and doesn't appear to be based off any existing source code of other RiveScript implementations.
* [Sidekick](https://getyoursidekick.org/) - "Get your very own Sidekick!" - A multi-network bot powered by Botkit and RiveScript, with support for Twitter and Slack.

Other RiveScript-related links that I need to find a home for on the official website somewhere:

* Syntax highlight plugins:
    * [Atom-RiveScript](https://github.com/aichaos/atom-rivescript) -- by me.
    * [SublimeText](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/RiveScript)
    * [vim syntax](https://static.rivescript.com/files/etc/vim-rivescript-0.01.tar.gz) -- by me. Really basic highlighting.
