# Bookmarks

This page will be my effort to migrate bookmarks out of my web browsers and onto this page. Because why should these
great links be locked away in Mozilla's heavily encrypted Sync service? I can probably keep track of them better myself,
and this way I won't have to worry about losing them to a browser glitch!

Also, some of these links may be helpful to others.

If you want to bookmark my bookmarks, then bookmark _this_ page, as I may be reorganizing some of these onto
sub-pages when this list gets too long.

* YouTube Videos:
  * [Alan Watts - Life is NOT a Journey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBpaUICxEhk) — we think of life as a pilgrimage, a journey to the end, the next big goal. Go to college, get married, have kids, retire. But we miss the point the whole way along: it was a musical thing and you were supposed to sing or to dance while the music was being played.
  * [Alan Watts - Law of Attraction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK_yGDn6BVQ)

## DP/DR

> Depersonalization is a state in which you perceive yourself from a third person
> perspective as a character in a dream. It is hard to cure because it is
> literally true. Your mind is just not supposed to remember that it is the
> author of the dream that your self experiences.
> [@Plinz](https://twitter.com/Plinz/status/1008961482804154368)

For me, a lot of the questions raised while experiencing DP/DR are philosophical
in nature so I categorize these links as a sub-genre of [Philosophy](#philosophy).

* [Depersonalization/Derealization on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depersonalization_disorder)
* [/r/dpdr](https://www.reddit.com/r/dpdr)
* YouTube Videos:
  * [Jim Carrey - What It All Means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTblbYqQQag)
  * [Alan Watts - Happiness is NOT the Meaning of Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsdoJ9x8IBs) — If you had the magic power to dream anything you wanted to dream -- be a superhero, have every kind of pleasure -- you would eventually dream where you are now. Of playing that you weren't God.
  * [Alan Watts Proves You Don't Exist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNKOUhx-7qk)
  * [Alan Watts - Are you ready to 'wake up'?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzeCv_WFnY)
