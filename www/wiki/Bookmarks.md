# Bookmarks

This page will be my effort to migrate bookmarks out of my web browsers and onto this page. Because why should these
great links be locked away in Mozilla's heavily encrypted Sync service? I can probably keep track of them better myself,
and this way I won't have to worry about losing them to a browser glitch!

Also, some of these links may be helpful to others.

If you want to bookmark my bookmarks, then bookmark _this_ page, as I may be reorganizing some of these onto
sub-pages when this list gets too long.
