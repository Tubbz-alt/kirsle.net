On a trip to old Drac’s castle,<br>
My team’s struck with grief and hassle.<br>
It was late in the months of fall,<br>
It seemed like the coldest month of all.

As we neared the castle, we saw in a tree,<br>
Several black bats, about twenty-three.<br>
A strong icy wind blew just now,<br>
And the cold hit us just like a plow.

The bats dropped from the tree in a blur of black,<br>
My team was frightened and stepped quickly back.<br>
As I started to run, I heard a scream so high,<br>
And as I looked back, I saw a man so nigh.

Lying down by the gate was a smelly old bum,<br>
He is just awakening, and he smells like rum.<br>
He was screaming for help, I couldn’t refuse,<br>
I slowly approached him, he fell to my shoes.

He picked himself up, still screaming for help,<br>
He was so unclear, it was a pitiful whelp.<br>
With a deafening scream, something emerged from the castle,<br>
It was the spirit of Prince Vlad, and his image struck hassle.

The bum and I, we commenced to flee,<br>
And Vlad looked angry, staring at me.<br>
I told the bum to continue on his own,<br>
And I turned around, and faced Vlad alone.

Vlad’s eyes were beet red, and badly bloodshot,<br>
He was building with fury, and quickly getting hot.<br>
I knew I should run, but I was curious to see more,<br>
Until Vlad left the castle, slamming the door.

At that point I paused, then I started to run,<br>
If I had stayed here, it wouldn’t be fun.<br>
I turned away, then hurried down the path,<br>
Such an evil nature that Prince Vlad hath.

Quickly enough, he was out of my sight,<br>
I was running so fast, I could’ve took flight.<br>
But I survived okay, and filled with hassle...<br>
And that was my trip to Dracula’s Castle.
